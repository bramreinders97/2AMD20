2AMD20 project

This project aims to merge 4 different datasets into one knowledge graph. The datasets to merge are:
-housing prices 
-housing availability
-population density
-movement between municipalities
The raw data can be found in the Data folder. The notebook used to clean this data is done in "Official_dataset_cleaning.ipynb" which can be found in the Code folder.
The output of this script are the cleaned datasets in cleanedDFs. The metaData folder contains all information on the original datasets.
